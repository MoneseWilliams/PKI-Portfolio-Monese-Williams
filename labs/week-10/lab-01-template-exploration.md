### Template Comparison

In your own words — what is the most significant difference between the User, Computer, and Web Server templates?

```
(your answer here — 3–5 sentences)
```

Why does the Web Server template use "Supplied in the request" for the subject name rather than building it from Active Directory?

   - Certificate Recipient: ________________

3. Opened the properties of the new duplicate template.

**General tab — changes made:**

| Setting | Original Value | New Value |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Template display name | Web Server | CVI-WebServer |
| Template name | WebServer | CVI-WebServer |
| Validity period | | |
| Renewal period | | |

**Rationale for validity period chosen:**

```
(why did you choose this period?)
```

**Subject Name tab — changes made:**

| Setting | Change Made | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| | | |

**Security tab — permissions confirmed:**

**Ensure Write and Enroll permissions are checked under Authenticated Users**

**Template saved:**

## Part C — Inspect the Duplicate Template with certutil

Run the following command on PKI-SRV01:

```powershell
certutil -template CVI-WebServer
```

**Full output:**

```
(paste output here)
```

**From the certutil output — record the following:**

| Field | Value from certutil Output |
